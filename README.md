# SMS-Text-Classifier
In this project, i have developed an SMS text classifier using deep learning techniques to categorize incoming messages as "ham" (regular) or "spam" (unwanted). 
By preprocessing and vectorizing the text data, and using an LSTM-based neural network, the model will be trained to accurately predict the likelihood of messages being spam or ham. 
This project aims to enhance the messaging experience by filtering out unwanted content and is a valuable step towards earning a Machine Learning Certification from Free Code Camp.
